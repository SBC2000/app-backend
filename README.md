# SBC2000 App Backend

Slightly improved port of https://github.com/SBC2000/legacy-app-backend to Typescript. Can be run in Heroku.

The API is still "almost" REST with hand-rolled cache control because that is what the frontend expects. This might be the starting point for a proper API once the frontend gets rewritten in something more maintainable.
